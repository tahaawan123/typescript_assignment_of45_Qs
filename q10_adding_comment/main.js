// 10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one
// comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too
// simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file.
// Then write one sentence describing what the program does
//create two variable for addition
var a = 12;
var b = 8;
// now create variable for result and  add both variable in result variable 
var result = a + b;
//now print the result
console.log(result);
