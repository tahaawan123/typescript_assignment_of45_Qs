// 10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one
// comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too
// simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file.
// Then write one sentence describing what the program does

//create two variable for addition
let a : number = 12;
let b : number = 8;
// now create variable for result and  add both variable in result variable 
let result = a + b; 
//now print the result
console.log(result);
